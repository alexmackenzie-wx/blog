A perennial document attempting to capture the history of cybersecurity. PRs welcome!

- Modern encryption tends to rely on what’s known as an “encryption key” (or key*s*) which stems from the work of ~Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century.
- 1970s and IBM designed a cipher (remember, an encrypt/decrypt function) named Lucifer which later became known as DES (Data Encryption Standard).
- 1976 asymmetric encryption began to bloom thanks to Whitfield Diffie & Martin Hellman.
- 1977 fuelled by Manischewitz (worth looking into), Rivest, Shamir and Adleman released the RSA asymmetric cipher.
- 2000 a new cipher was adopted known as Rijndael (pronounced rain-dahl) or the Advanced Encryption Standard.
- Thinkst Canary founded in 2015.
- 2022 the first four quantum-resistant algorithms (thank you lattices) were announced.
