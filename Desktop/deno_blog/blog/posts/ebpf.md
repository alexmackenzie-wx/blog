*“Some say software is eating the world, I would say that: BPF is eating software”*

To paraphrase [Brad Gerstner](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/altimeter-with-brad-gerstner), there are two broad approaches to investing: “working the cocktail circuit” or being an “anthropologist”. At the cocktail parties I’ve attended of late, touting ~new ways to program the Linux kernel isn’t always a surefire way to make friends, so anthropology it is. Like many emerging technologies (a la WebAssembly), it isn’t exclusively eBPF itself that represents a direct opportunity, but also the potential second-order solutions that the technology enables.

The market adjacent to eBPF is easy to get excited about. Linux is the world’s [most used](https://frameboxxindore.com/other/what-percentage-of-servers-are-linux.html#:~:text=90%25%20of%20all%20cloud%20infrastructure%20operates%20on%20Linux) operating system — the trillion-dollar cloud runs on Linux. Yet despite its popularity, [Brendan Gregg](https://www.brendangregg.com/) has famously likened the Linux kernel to HTML — a non-programmable file.
