"It's not even wrong"

*Should you wish to stay updated on future posts, subscribe to receive carrier pidgeons at my [substack](https://whynowtech.substack.com/).*

As I've [mentioned](https://mack.work/advice_aggregated) previously, venture is a business of aggregation. I've decided to "open source" some of the content playbooks I've come across (in the public domain!) used by developer tools to build, developer love.

[Pull requests](https://github.com/alexmackenzie-wx/blog) are encouraged if you have a learning to share! & I'm at alex[at]tapestry[dot]vc if you want to say hello.

**Manifestos**

Manifestos are the perfect medium to be opinionated/drop "hot takes". It's important to be thought of/loved for something; even if some cohort of developers will vehemently object.

**You vs. Your Competitor**

It's important that you own the you vs. your competitor narrative (vs. your competitors!). Conceding on certain areas/features creates legitimacy.

**Company / Product Launches**

**Build vs. Buy**

Developers often could *theoretically* build your product. It's important that you provide a list of factors that they should take into account when considering doing so. Bonus points if you can ~impartially point out why doing so would be a poor use of time/company resources.

**Buyer's Guide**

It's, naturually, important to own the criteria that potential buyers should take into account when evaluating a solution. I haven't yet found a developer tool do a good job of buyers' guides, likely because dev tools often follow a bottoms-up gtm. EqualTo does a great job.

**Porting from Competitor**

- \>> [Northflank](https://northflank.com/blog/heroku-alternatives-and-how-to-migrate)'s Heroku alternatives & how to migrate.
- \>> [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/blog/replace-your-django-database-with-planetscale)'s porting from your Django DB.

---

**Dev Community Pages**

Spotlighting what your community builds with your product incentivises your users to continue to build with your product & often results in free marketing.  

- \>> [Rasa](https://rasa.com/showcase/)'s community showcase. 
- \>> [Scale](https://exchange.scale.com/)'s community exchange. 
- \>> [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces)'s community spaces.

**Content Partnerships**

- \>> [Sysdig](https://medium.com/@SkyscannerEng/kubernetes-security-monitoring-at-scale-with-sysdig-falco-a60cfdb0f67a)'s appraisal via Skyscanner.
- \>> [Hex](https://hex.tech/blog/#:~:text=Sep%2028%2C%202022-,ELSEWHERE,-Hex%20scores%20%2452M) has an "elsewhere" section within their blog page.

**How We Built X**

**The State Of X**

Creating a report on the "state of" your domain, 1) positions you as a leader in the domain & 2) is great for backlinking if (you provide unique data)

- \>> [Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/how-the-web-evolves)'s "State of the Web". 

---

**Educational Content**

My general rule of thumb here is to remember your audience/your content objectives. You'll accumulate plenty of vanity impressions for writing a blog post on something generic (a la "what is Python") but if your audience are developers, are they really searching for something this high-level?

- \>> [Sym's](https://blog.symops.com/2022/09/07/evolution-access-control-python/) evolution of access control via Python.
- \>> [Roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-coreml/)'s "ML in a minute".
