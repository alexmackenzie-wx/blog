"It's not even wrong"

*Should you wish to stay updated on future posts, subscribe to receive carrier pidgeons at my [substack](https://whynowtech.substack.com/).*

As I've [mentioned](https://mack.work/advice_aggregated) previously, venture is a business of aggregation. I've decided to "open source" some of the content playbooks I've come across (in the public domain!) used by developer tools to build, developer love.

[Pull requests](https://github.com/alexmackenzie-wx/blog) are encouraged if you have a learning to share! & I'm at alex[at]tapestry[dot]vc if you want to say hello.
