**Founders**

- Honest audacity. In many ways, it's outrageous to think that you can change the world, but this self-belief, if paired with radical self-evaluation/candour is the forcing function to do so.
- People that scare me. Inspired by Graham Duncan.
- Steep slopes.
- Life's work entrepreneurs.
- Chips on shoulders put chips in pockets.
- Some people just feel inevitable.
- Look for historians.
- "Idea maze" navigated. 

**Products**

- World's most important companies.
- Toothbrush test.
- Accidents of history.
- Logical end states. (Palmer)
- The "Slinky", eBPF, etc.
- Power of defaults.
- The half-life of data.
- Revenue quality.
- Look for what sucks.

**Markets**

- Abrubpt change.
- Future here, just not evenly distributed. Look at HackerOne for example - "white hat" hackers already a thing at large cos.
- Non-consensus and right.
- "Why Now"
- Keep in mind both absolute topline as well as gross margins. 99% GMs on $1k is irrelevant.
