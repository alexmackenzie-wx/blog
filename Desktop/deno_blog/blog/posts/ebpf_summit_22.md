eBPF is Infra++

The good folk at Isovalent were kind enough to welcome me "on stage" to share a venture capitalist's perspective on eBPF.

This was a cool experience as the very first instance of [“Why Now”](https://whynowtech.substack.com/) was a primer on eBPF. Thanks to those of you who subbed from day one!
