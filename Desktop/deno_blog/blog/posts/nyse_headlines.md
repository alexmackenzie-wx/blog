I have found that asking founders what their company's future headline/tagline upon IPO will be is a helpful proxy to assess ambition, market scope, poetic tendencies... etc. What is the lofty vision that they will have achieved. This post is my amalgamation of some of my favourite examples from over the years.

Note: I'm also going to include later-stage funding taglines. It's my blog after all, I can do what I like!
